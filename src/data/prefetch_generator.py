        This function transforms generator into a background-thead generator.

        It can be used with any minibatch generator.

        It is quite lightweight, but not entirely weightless.
        Using global variables inside generator is not recommended (may rise GIL and zero-out the benefit of having a background thread.)
        The ideal use case is when everything it requires is store inside it and everything it outputs is passed through queue.

        There's no restriction on doing weird stuff, reading/writing files, retrieving URLs [or whatever] wlilst iterating.

        :param max_prefetch: defines, how many iterations (at most) can background generator keep stored at any moment of time.
        Whenever there's already max_prefetch batches stored in queue, the background process will halt until one of these batches is dequeued.

        !Default max_prefetch=1 is okay unless you deal with some weird file IO in your generator!

        Setting max_prefetch to -1 lets it store as many batches as it can, which will work slightly (if any) faster, but will require storing
        all batches in memory. If you use infinite generator with max_prefetch=-1, it will exceed the RAM size unless dequeued quickly enough.
